# Covid-19-News-Classifier-and-Symtom-Predictor

### My project and Web-application “Covid-19 News Classifier and Risk Predictor” is designed to curb the Fake News, which are often circulated on social media platforms regarding the Covid-19, which are no doubt harmful and misguiding because we tend to believe on some of these News, which are Fake in Nature, also due to these Fake News, the Real News are Neglected.
 
### This Project aims to keep us away from these Fake news, Just by typing any News about Covid-19, as an Input, the News Classifier will result, whether the News is Fake, or Not Fake. The second part of the project consists of “Covid-19 Risk Predictor”, its always good to ensure, at what extent are we away from dangerous Corona Virus, this second part of my project takes Parameters as input such as Age, Gender, Body temperature, etc, and results what percentage of Low, Medium and High amount of risk the user is facing in a percentage format. In any instance the High-risk percentage is maximum, it is suggested to visit the doctor as early as possible.

### Both sections of my project “Covid-19 News Classifier and Risk Predictor” are been trained using efficient NLP and Ensemble Algorithms and deployed as a “Web-Application” on Heroku, which is a container-based cloud Platform as a Service (PaaS). The only intention behind this Project and Web-application is to contribute a part of safety from the Covid-19 outbreak, also encouraging to stay home and stay safe.
